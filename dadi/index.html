monitor data that's critical to you</pre>
<br>
DaDi (Data Display) enables managers to make better decisions, by monitoring 
mission critical information in real-time. It achieves this by collating real 
time information from various sources of the organization and pushes it 
immediately to one or more desktops.<br>
<br>
Designed on the concept similar to Television Broadcast, it provides the
flexibility of choosing what information needs to be displayed and
also provides the necessary security features for restricted access.<br>
<br>
DaDi works in existing corporate networks. It can work via. the
Intranet/Internet and support roaming users via. VPN. It integrates seamlessly via.
firewalls/proxys and intrusion detection systems, requiring no changes to
existing network infrastructure. IT administrators find it a joy to work with; 
deploying the client in desktops takes seconds. Since it works with existing 
web-servers, it requires no complicated setups. Application Developers who would 
write custom data adapters for data channels will find our API simple and easy 
to program with.<br>
<br>
DaDi is indispensable for managers who want to:
<ul>
  <li>Monitor mission critical information in real-time</li>
  <li>Get notified of critical events, enabling them to take corrective action</li>
  <li>Track progress of specific tasks</li>
  <li>Broadcast news/event information to all/selected desktops</li>
  <li>.</li>
</ul>
<p>to find out how DaDi will enable your organization, do send us an email at
dadi@houseofkodai.in - so we can schedule a demo (takes only a few minutes over
the phone/internet) and later setup a customized pilot, so your management can
experience the benefits of DaDi.<br/>
