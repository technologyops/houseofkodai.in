  <p>some of our current projects include, getting a cow and a calf, planting more trees to watch them grow, getting wireless broadband Internet access, helping improve India\'s legal delivery system, building web-services for various organizations, figuring out how to control the world (jus kidding, wanted to make sure you were reading this far...)</p>\

<h1>dd's questions</h1>\
\
<h3>what's dd?</h3>\
its' more of who's dd? This stands for Dilip's Delicious (although he delightfully suggested dumb ;-) questions. Who's dilip you may wonder, just ask him yourself? he's been wondering about it, his whole life; he even spent a star-studded night and warm day, all alone, in the ancient forest of kombe, trying to figure it out!<br/><br/>\
\
<h3>what are you guys trying to do?</h3>\
<em>what we harvest today, you eat tomorrow</em><br/><br/> \
our objective is to supply you with \"organic foods\" that are freshly harvested from the remote hills of Kodaikanal. The plan is, for us to supply you with a \"bok\" (box of kodai) of organic farm produce one Sunday every month. Among other things, our bok will contain vegetables that were harvested the day before in our farm.<br/><br/>\
\
while some of us have always dreamt of eating freshly harvested farm produce; you may have believed that it was not practical to do this in urban areas. With your support, we can make this happen.<br/><br/>\
\
<h3>how is this supposed to work?</h3>\
we inform you a week in advance (via. email) as to what produce this month's bok is going to contain and what it is going to cost. Once you confirm your participation, we will add you to our delivery list.<br/><br/>\
\
that weekend; we harvest the produce, clean them, pack them and load it into a truck - which travels overnight to your city and delivers it to your home the next day.<br/><br/>\
\
<h3>which places do you deliver to?</h3>\
we are starting with <strong>chennai</strong><br/><br/>\
\
since we live in kodaikanal, we are limited by travel-time of about 10 hours or a distance of about 500 kms. We need about 250 customers in a city to make delivering there economically feasible.<br/><br/>\
\
we are considering bangalore next; just waiting for 250 of you bangaloreans to connect with us ;-)<br/><br/>\
\
<h3>what chemicals do you use to clean/store your produce?</h3>\
we're puzzled - did we mention that we don't use any chemicals to grow our crops; its all organic :-). When we harvest the crops; we wash them in a running mountain stream (real mineral water), dry them, pack them, load it in a truck and send it to your home - so you can cook and eat it, the very next day!<br/><br/>\
\
<h3>can you supply us with all the fruits/vegetables we get in the market?</h3>\
nope, not right now.<br/><br/>\
\
organic farming is a time-consuming ancient art form! We should be grateful for nature's bounty. One needs to respect nature and consume produce only during its season - not at all times. It is nothing less than greed, to expect/demand things that suit our taste and convenience!<br/><br/>\
\
our area has soil/weather conditions that are suitable only for select fruits/vegetables. Most vegetables will be farmed/harvested on non-winter months (about 7 months from April to October). Fruits such as plums, peaches, oranges, berries will be available in the months of February, March, April<br/><br/>\
\
perhaps, one day when several communities are formed to follow our model of farming/distribution, it may be possible.<br/><br/>\
\
<h3>If I eat this once a month and the rest of the time I eat the regular, inorganic stuff - how does it help me stay healthy?</h3>\
they say that the journey to conquer Mt. Everest started with a small step. Lets consider this the first step towards leading simpler lives and consuming organic food all the time. There is also another saying, that one cannot have the cake and eat it too - it is highly unlikely that one would be able to eat fresh organic food all the time in urban centers, where food production is all but impossible due to exorbitant land prices.<br/><br/>\
\
practically, we would suggest a change in lifestyle from fast-paced urban to peaceful rural; where the air is cleaner, water is purer, and you get to know the land and people who grow your food for you.<br/><br/>\
\
<h3>do you plan on delivering boks more than once a month?</h3>\
anything's possible; however, we're just starting and have a long way to go before we streamline/stabilize our operations. We're hoping to achieve that in the next few months. After that, with sufficient demand/participation from folks like you, we will certainly do it.<br/><br/>\
\
<h3>can you include organic produce from others in the bok?</h3>\
that is certainly the plan; most fruits are grown organically - the main reason being that fruit trees have virtually no need to be taken care of; the predominant effort is keeping the land clear and harvesting once a year. Certain salads and vegetables are also grown organically as they require very little effort in maintenance.<br/><br/>the feedback we have received after the first bok up was soul-filling; not only from folks like you, but also from our farming neighbors. A few of them have approached us and have promised to grow vegetables organically.<br/><br/>do be assured; since it is our reputation at stake, we will ensure that anything that is included in the bok is organically grown and freshly harvested.<br/><br/>\
\
<h3>are you certified?</h3>\
we don't believe in wasting time and effort and increasing costs in conforming to \"some expert opinion\" - we follow ancient (mostly undocumented) practices; our philosophy/practice is to not use \"chemicals\" of any sort.<br/><br/>We believe that as our customers - you are the only one qualified to certify our work. Do visit us, see how we work, have a cup of tea/coffee, chat with us and feel free to \"certify\" us yourself.<br/><br/>\
\
for others, who are too lazy/busy to visit us and blindly believe in the fancy words, printed on labels, from committees of Ph.Ds from reputed institutions - good luck!<br/><br/>\
\
<h3>why are you doing this?</h3>\
simply because, we'd like to share our lives with you; to educate the urbanite that fresh food comes from farming the land organically using traditional methods - not from certified plastic packets (labeled as fresh !) in store shelves.<br/><br/>\
\
our aspirations are for this to be a community-involved effort, particularly \"not\" a commercial effort. We want this effort to be self sustainable model, in the smallest possible scale - and grow by encouraging others to adopt our model of living/working.<br/><br/>\
<h3>are you expensive?</h3>\
expensive is a relative term - by consuming fresh produce you avoid potential health problems (where do you think the chemical/fertilizer/preservatives sprayed on the farm produce goes?!) and the associated costs of getting well again. In this context, we are very cheap (hmmm, maybe we should charge you more for the preventive health care we are providing ;-)<br/><br/>\
\
we believe in adding value; by convincing the farmers around us to grow organic foods the way our forefathers did - and convincing you to enjoy consuming our fresh farm produce.<br/><br/>\
\
our role is to encourage/motivate villagers/farmers, using economic means, to go back to basics - while we would certainly like to have the resources of the tatas, ambanis, bill gates, government of India, fortune 100...as you can see, we certainly don't! Even without large financial resources, with your active participation, we can change our lives for the better ;-)<br/><br/>\
\
now seriously; by delivering our produce direct to your homes, we are eliminating costs associated with the middle-man/distribution-centers. One of our biggest cost is transport (btw, govt. of India, in case you are reading this - transportation is the biggest enemy of the farmer - not loans/fertilizers/price-guarantees/etc.) the other is labor (the current flood of govt. giveaways has encouraged villagers to stop working - if you think we are kidding, spend at-least a few weeks in a village of your choice and decide for yourself). We are investing more money with local villagers/farmers to encourage them to work with us.<br/><br/>\
\
we have started a journey to create a sustainable model, where everybody benefits - we the farmer and you the consumer. Your whole-hearted participation is essential to making this succeed.<br/><br/>\
\
for the record, the is \"not\" and will \"never\" become a commercial venture; where profit always preceeds people.<br/><br/>\
\
you may find our prices slightly higher than inorganic foods; If you cannot afford what we produce, do convince us and we will give it for free - but, please don't ask us about pricing; lest we \"blacklist\" you for having said so !-)\
