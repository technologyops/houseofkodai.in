<h1>5G is dead: long live WiFi6</h1>
<hr>
<h2>What do users care about ?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>24x7 reliable, fast, <strong>Internet</strong> connectivity.</p>
<ul>
<li>first for their mobiles.</li>
<li>then for other connected devices: laptops, smart-tv, IoT, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>cost - lower is always better.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>But, what about voice calls ?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Voice over 2G/3G/LTE is facing the same fate as land-line calls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smart-phones have blurred the distinction between normal voice-calls and voice-over-internet calls.
Users use apps to make calls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chat+Voice+Video over the internet is the new norm.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Telecom Network Architecture</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fibre-backbone with wireless for last-mile connectivity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LTE cell-site coverage has reduced to 300m !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5G will reduce the cell-site coverage area even more.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fibre-internet + last-mile WiFi6</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Will the users notice the difference ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the &quot;intentional complexity&quot; of the existing telecom networks warrant a higher price ?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>WhyFi6 ?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Licensed spectrum is an artificial barrier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spectral efficiency is the key.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WiFi6 techniques such as OFDMA, and MU-MIMO have finally brought feature parity with LTE/5G.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A single WiFi6 access point can provide internet bandwidth to 100s of simultaneous stations, <strong>today</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technology evolution</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Traditionally telecom networks had a technology shelf life in decades.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then came mobile - which brought it down from 10 to 5 years (2G,3G,4G).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now with 5G and beyond, they will need to adopt to a much shorter upgrade cycle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WiFi7 will be out sooner than 5G rollout is complete !</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Internet Economy</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What people use are the <em>only</em> standards that matter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users want things that work <em>now</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Internet feedback is faster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>100 million WiFi6 devices were released before the official standard was ratified !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Organizations that move at internet speed will thrive, others will perish faster than they hope!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>A simple network</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>WiFi6 Mesh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fibre-internet-gateways</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IPv6 only</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The nano ISP !</h2>
<ul>
<li>Anybody with a fibre-internet connection can become an ISP !</li>
</ul>
<p>Needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Incentives, financial/other, to manage and share Internet bandwidth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plug-n-deploy with automated cloud managed configuration/upgrades.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>WiFi6 is currently available only on flagship mobiles, costing about US $400/- 3-5 years is the estimate, when WiFi6 enabled mobile phones will reach price point of US $100/- and attain critical-mass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Software engineering to provide a simple/immediate User eXperience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Telecom companies who have invested a lot in retaining their oligopoly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regulatory.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>What next ?</h2>
<p>That's the trillion $ question :-D</p>
<p>While I do see this as a disruptive technology - it's success in the marketplace probably depends more upon the political/social challenges.</p>
<p>So far, even big-tech: Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. have steered clear of entering this segment.</p>
<p>I do realize this expression is abrupt/in-complete; It aspires to instigate thought, enable discussions, and maybe more !</p>
