# 5G is dead: long live WiFi6

---

## What do users care about ?

* 24x7 reliable, fast, **Internet** connectivity.
  + first for their mobiles.
  + then for other connected devices: laptops, smart-tv, IoT, etc.

* cost - lower is always better.


## But, what about voice calls ?

* Voice over 2G/3G/LTE is facing the same fate as land-line calls.

* Smart-phones have blurred the distinction between normal voice-calls and voice-over-internet calls. 
  Users use apps to make calls.

* Chat+Voice+Video over the internet is the new norm.


## Telecom Network Architecture

* Fibre-backbone with wireless for last-mile connectivity.

* LTE cell-site coverage has reduced to 300m !

* 5G will reduce the cell-site coverage area even more.


## Fibre-internet + last-mile WiFi6

* Will the users notice the difference ?

* Does the "intentional complexity" of the existing telecom networks warrant a higher price ?

## WhyFi6 ?

* Licensed spectrum is an artificial barrier.

* Spectral efficiency is the key.

* WiFi6 techniques such as OFDMA, and MU-MIMO have finally brought feature parity with LTE/5G.

* A single WiFi6 access point can provide internet bandwidth to 100s of simultaneous stations, **today**.


## Technology evolution

* Traditionally telecom networks had a technology shelf life in decades.

* Then came mobile - which brought it down from 10 to 5 years (2G,3G,4G).

* Now with 5G and beyond, they will need to adopt to a much shorter upgrade cycle.

*  WiFi7 will be out sooner than 5G rollout is complete !


## Internet Economy

* What people use are the _only_ standards that matter.

* Users want things that work _now_.

* Internet feedback is faster.

* 100 million WiFi6 devices were released before the official standard was ratified !

* Organizations that move at internet speed will thrive, others will perish faster than they hope!


## A simple network

* WiFi6 Mesh

* fibre-internet-gateways

* IPv6 only


## The nano ISP !

* Anybody with a fibre-internet connection can become an ISP !

Needs:

* Incentives, financial/other, to manage and share Internet bandwidth.

* Plug-n-deploy with automated cloud managed configuration/upgrades.


## The Challenges

* WiFi6 is currently available only on flagship mobiles, costing about US $400/- 3-5 years is the estimate, when WiFi6 enabled mobile phones will reach price point of US $100/- and attain critical-mass.

* Software engineering to provide a simple/immediate User eXperience.

* Telecom companies who have invested a lot in retaining their oligopoly.

* Regulatory.


## What next ?

That's the trillion $ question :-D

While I do see this as a disruptive technology - it's success in the marketplace probably depends more upon the political/social challenges.

So far, even big-tech: Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. have steered clear of entering this segment. 

I do realize this expression is abrupt/in-complete; It aspires to instigate thought, enable discussions, and maybe more !
